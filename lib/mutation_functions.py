  Args:
    corpus_element: A CorpusElement object. It's assumed in this case that
      corpus_element.data[0] is a numpy representation of an image and
      corput_element.data[1] is a label or something we *don't* want to change.
    mutations_count: Integer representing number of mutations to do in
      parallel.
    constraint: If not None, a constraint on the norm of the total mutation.
    a_min, a_max: Constraints on the values of the mutated input

  Returns:
    A list of batches, the first of which is mutated images and the second of
    which is passed through the function unchanged (because they are image
    labels or something that we never intended to mutate).
